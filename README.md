# Combing-Traversal
Finding a particular node in a graph using DFS and BFS traversal.  Traversal from the farthest Node points in a graph and finally finding the targeted Node Responsibilities  Did the Research Problem from scratch by applying BFS,DFS algorithm along with backtracking .  Created the algorithm by taking assumptions and lot of trail and error.
